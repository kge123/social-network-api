# Social Network API

## Description

Social Media is a powerful tool used by just about most everyone now a days in some form. With this application I will create an API server for a social network application where users can share thoughts, react to friend's thoughts and create a friends list. In this application we will use Express.js and Mongoose packages.

## User Story
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Demonstration

Screencastify was used for the demonstration and due to only being able to record for 5 minutes without paying the subscription, we made 2 videos. Part 1 Demo video is demonstrating viewing all users, finding users by ID, creating a new user, updating a user, deleting a user, adding a friend and removing a friend. Part 2 Demo video is demonstrating viewing all thoughts, finding the thoughts by ID, creating a new thought, updating a thought, deleting a thought, creating a reaction to a thought and deleting a reaction from a thought.
